2009-02-01 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The shogi-server records csa files of games in an illegal
	    format. This issue has been fixed. (Closes: #14635)
	  - A ##[MONITOR] command for showing a game result such as %TORYO
	    was not correct. This issue has been fixed.  

2009-01-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - It failed to proccess a game result, OuteKaihiMoreWin where a
	    checked king does not escape. This issue has been fixed.

2009-01-02 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - shogi_server/timeout_queue.rb: the timeout parameter of the
	    constructor was not respected erroneously. This issue
	    has been fixed.
	  - shogi_server/players.rb: When a player was finishing with its
	    write socket broken, there was a chance that the thread of the
	    player in the giant lock had to wait for a long time (about 20
	    seconds), which might cause threads of other players stop and 
	    time out. (Closes: #14469)

2008-12-30 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Added a new option: --footer filename, which inserts contents of 
	    the filename at the bottom of a genrated page. A text specific to 
	    wdoor should be written by using this option. 
	    (Closes: #14470)
	  - It does no more depend on RDoc. RDoc::usage does not work well
	    (due to RDoc).

2008-12-28 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Check kifu files more carefully so that files that contain
	    incomplete records are skipped.
	  - mk_rate might have failed to alloc due to out of memory. Now it
	    consumes less memory (about 200MB instead of 2GB).
	  - File names can be put into STDIN instead of specifying directory
	    names in command line arguments.
	* [csa-file-filter]
	  - New file. It filters kifu files and is of use for a pre-filter
	    of mk_rate.

2008-12-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Improved an existance check and etc. of directories specified
	    by command line options, expecially in case of the daemon mode. 
	    (Closes: #14244)
	  - A lotated log file is moved to $topdir/YYYY/MM/DD.
	    (Closes: #14245)

2008-11-27 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added sample/*.sh for command line samples.

2008-11-24 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new option --floodgate-history, which allows users to
	    specify a file name that stores the records of games. The
	    records are taken care of when games are matched.

2008-10-18 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [utils/eval_graph.rb]
	  - Display time control graphs as well.
	    Thanks to Nishimura-san for this idea.
	    (Closes: #13678)

2008-10-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Ruby 1.8.7 (or later) must be used. Ruby 1.8.6 is not supported.
	  - Daemon mode is available.
	  - shogi_server/piece_ky.rb is again merged with
	    shogi_server/piece.rb, then has been removed.  
	  - Added a test case, TC_usi.rb.

2008-06-30 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new option --player-log-dir, which allows users to log
	    messages that are received or sent to the wire.

2008-06-28 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A rating comment line is now written before the first move in a
	    record file instead of after the last move, which allows other
	    applications watching a game to recognize players in the middle 
	    of the game. (Closes #12821)
	  - If a player, including a monitor, stuck at the time of sending
	    messages to the wire, which means that the giant lock was locked,
	    it might have prevented other players from processing until
	    timeout occurred. This issue has been fixed. (Closes #12555)

2008-06-27 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  -  Pairing players might not have shuffled players because of
	     poor shuffling algorithm. This issue has been fixed.
	     (Closes: #12661)

2008-06-25 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [players_graph.rb]
	  - Check invalid arguments. (Closes: #12856)

2008-06-23 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - Added a new option: --fixed-rate and --fixed-rate-player
	    whose rate always results in that rate. (Closes: #12800)

2008-06-06 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The source has been splited to multiple sub files.
	  - The program now depends on rubygems and activesupport.
	  - The program can reload the source files on the flight, by
	    sending a HUP signal to the server.
	  - The server log will be rotated daily.

2008-05-18 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Last game results (win or lose) of x1 players were not
	    available on the next game. This issue has been fixed.
	    Thanks to Tomoyuki Kaneko for debugging.
	  - For draw games, "'rating" line in a .csa file was 
	    wrong (meaningless). This issue has been fixed.

2008-05-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [news]
	  - The repository has been converted from CVS to Subversion.

2008-05-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Floodgate's thread could cause an error when players.yaml was
	    cleared by another program (mk_rate). This issue has been 
	    fixed.
	  - Give default values to BasicPlayer, which fixed undefined 
	    method error in Pairing.

2008-05-10 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The server could not recognize uchifuzume as an illegal move.
	    This bug has been fixed.
	  - The server crashed by an undefined method error.
	    This issue has been fixed.

2008-05-05 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - .csa files will be located in a sub directory such as
	    "2008/05/05/*.csa". Thease days, we have many games in a day. 
	    This change will help users browse a file list.

2008-05-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Show players who have accessed in the last 30 minutes with 
	    different colors.

2008-04-22 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - When YSS was not rated on the wdoor mode, wrong rate24 scores
	    were displayed. This issue has been fixed. Now YSS absence 
	    results in "N/A".

2008-04-21 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - The half-life period is now configurable.
	    ex $ ./mk_rate --half-life 14 --half-life-ignore 7 <records>

2008-04-12 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Renamed variables (@id) since they caused Ruby's warning.

2008-04-11 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Improved a way to handle diferred moves (2008-03-24's change),
	    based on Tomoyuki Kaneko's patch.

2008-04-01 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - An incorrect LOGIN crashed the server. This issue has been
	    fixed.

2008-03-24 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Converting characters for comments in moves caused an error. This 
	    issue has been fixed.
	  - If a player moves in the opponent's turn, it is illegal. But the
	    current CSA protocol does not clearly define a way to tell so to 
	    the players. This shogi-server internally keeps such a move in a
	    buffer and replay it when the player of the move gets his/her 
	    turn.

2008-03-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Erroneously, Board#to_s's current player was always Black.
	    It caused wrong determination of sennichite since it did not
	    care about the current player of a state. This has been fixed.
	    Thanks Takada-san for reporting this bug.

2008-03-10 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [util/players-graph.rb]
	  - Applied Kaneko-san's patch, which also shows expected-rate24
	    rates.
	  - Small PNG gets smaller.

2008-03-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	- Added an option --wdoor. In this mode, a rate expected at Shogi
	  Club 24 is calculated from YSS's rating (he is 2400 now). 

2008-03-04 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	  - If the computed ratings do not stabilize, then mk_rate aborts.
	      $ ./mk_rate dir && ./mk_rate dir > players.yaml 
	    can avoid rewriting the invalid ratings to the file.

2008-02-23 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - A comment is converted to EUC-JP and then written in a log.
	    Note that this conversion guesses the input encoding. Clients
	    are recommended to send EUC-JP compatible strings to the
	    server.

2008-02-21 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [util/players-graph.rb]
	  - Released. Draw a chart for a player's rating score.

2008-02-17 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - An illegal teban specified for Floodgate login could crash the
	    server. This issue has been fixed.

2008-02-16 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Thread.abort_on_exception is now false, meaning that 
	    a thread's abort does not affect the others. 
	  - The uchifuzume check did not generate promoting moves, which
	    could crash the server with illegal moves. This issue has
	    been fixed.

2008-02-14 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Added a new pairing variation, Swiss-like style. Winners at the
	    previous games (his/her point of view, not the server's) are 
	    paired first, and then the others are matched. This is the 
	    default option now.
	  - Pairing classes are located in a separate source file,
	    pairing.rb. The file is 'load'ed each time to be used,
	    meaning that modifying the code will be applied to a running
	    server.
	  - You can specify a single player who will be out of pairing
	    when there are odd players waiting for Floodgate.

2008-02-13 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - When there are odd players wating for Floodgate, the random
	    pairing deletes the player who has ever played the most games.

2008-02-08 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [ml_html]
	  - For the Not-Yet-Rated group, those who have not connected
	    recently are not listed.
	* [shogi-server]
	  - Floodgate's thread checks the current time each 10 secs.

2008-02-05 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] [mk_html]
	  - Display not-yet-rated players as well.
	* [mk_html]
	  - Use Yahoo! UI Library.

2008-02-04 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] [webserver]
	  - In the daemon mode, if the specified directory was a relative
	    path, the server could fail to start with a permission denied
	    error. This issue has been fixed. The path is interpreted as 
	    an absolute path before switching to daemon. 
	  - In the daemon mode, a wrong process id was written in 
	    '--pid-file'. This issue has been fixed. Also, the pid file
	    will be removed when the server shuts down.

2008-02-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Game names that are recognized as the floodgate mode are now 
	    /^floodgate-\d+-\d+$/.
	  - Floodgate could not schedule the next time when it was the next
	    day. This issue has been fixed.

2008-02-02 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented a new feature, Floodgate mode, for covenience with
	    public rating games. Now there is a special game "wdoor-900-0".
	    Matching players for that game is scheduled each 30 minitues.

2007-11-03 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate]
	 - Support Ruby 1.8.6 patch level 111 (or higher) and GSL 1.10 (or higher).
	   It may not work with lower verions. 

2007-09-06 Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - The logic to detect Oute-Sennichite was not complete. Both players
	    (checking side and escaping side) may cause Oute-Sennichite. The old
	    logic only cared for the checking player. This issue has been fixed.

2007-06-16  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [webserver]
	  - Initial version. This web server is an interface between HTTP and
	    shogi-server. Shogi-server commands will be available over HTTP. As
	    of now %%LIST and %%WHO commands are supported.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Bumped up GAME_LIMIT (from 10) to 15 because the calculation of
	    rates sometimes went wrong (infinite values).

2007-04-21  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented `CHALLENGE' command, and the server will respond with
	    `CHALLENGE ACCEPTED'. Note that this command is dummy for this server
	    because it is only available for CSA's official testing server and does
	    not belong to the CSA standard protocol.  Therefor, when clients receive
	    `CHALLENGE ACCEPTED' from this server, they must ignore it.
	  - Show revision in a start up message.

2007-04-01  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Implemented one of the keepalive protocol in CSA protocol; If clients
	    send LF, the server sends back LF.
	  - More care for socket errors.

2007-03-27  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] When there were too few games to rate players (i.e. no
	  player to rate), mk_rate caused an error. Now it no longer shows
	  the error.

2007-03-10  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html] Popup shows additional information.

2007-03-02  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	  - Use WEBrick for server framework.
	  - Daemon mode is available.

2007-02-26  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Failed to show usage. This issue has been fixed. 
	  - Initial start of the server failed beacause of empty players.yaml.
	    This issues has been fixed.

2007-02-18  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_html]
	  - Show groups in the order specified in players.html.
	  - Players who gamed recently have a background color.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Implemented half-life effect. Numbers of win/lose decrease by this effect.

2006-11-26  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server] Sente (gote) was able to move gote's (sente's) hand.
	  That move should be illegal. This issue has been fixed.

2006-11-01  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Skip "abnormal" games, which were finished because of
	  network failure or communication error.  Recently some programs seem
	  to have a lot of tries to connect to the Shogi Server at wdoor for
	  debugging. We should ignore such games for a while to get a meaningful
	  ratings.

2006-10-30  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate][mk_html]
	  - Put players into "connected" groups in order to
	    show a correct, meaningful rating. In the group, each player has at
	    least a game with other players.
	  - The format of players.yaml was updated.
	* [shogi-server] Followed the new format of players.yaml.

2006-10-08  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Corrected making win_loss_matrix.

2006-10-02  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] players who never win or lose are not rated in order
	  the calculation to complete.

2006-09-30  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Remove the trip in a password. Now the password is hashed.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Support @NORATE syntax in a name, which avoids the player is
	    rated.

2006-09-09  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Support a new command, %%VERSION. It shows the server's revision#.

2006-09-07  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [shogi-server]
	  - Re-design: trip is now a suffix of the password, not name.
	  - Simplified the output of %%RATING.
	* [mk_rate]
	  - Support "@" indentificaton in a name; players with same
	    before-@-names are mapped to one.

2006-09-05  Daigo Moriwaki <daigo at debian dot org>

	* [mk_rate] Fix a bug. It solves the correct rate.
